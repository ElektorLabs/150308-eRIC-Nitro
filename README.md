150308 eRIC Nitro
=================

Arduino Micro compatible module with on-board LPRS eRIC low-power smart radio module. 
Supports eRIC4 (433 MHz) and eRIC9 (865/915 MHz) modules.

The board offers several operating modes:

- MCU controls eRIC through hardware UART

- MCU controls eRIC through software UART

- MCU cooperates with eRIC, eRIC controlled by PC 


Note that eRIC modules can function fully stand-alone, without any help from a
microcontroller. This board can handle that too.

The board is included in the Elektor Arduino Boards Package available at https://github.com/ElektorLabs/Arduino/
